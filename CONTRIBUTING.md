## Ideas for the Future

We are constantly seeking to adopt our development practice to established and widely accepted norms. Yet we cannot know everything, so please get in touch if something important is missing.

### Native Web Apps

As long as we consider the optimal deployment strategy for sustain- and scalable web services in the combination of independent, client side [Native Web Apps](http://blog.andyet.com/2015/01/22/native-web-apps) and highly flexible APIs like [Hydra](http://www.hydra-cg.com/), TransforMap aims at exploring the full potential of such [distributed](http://hyperboot.mx/), [offline](http://laniakea.im/) first services.

A first idea could be to implement the [Hyperboot webapp bootloader](http://hyperboot.org/).
Additionally, federated scenarios like the [Federated Wiki](http://fed.wiki.org/) will impose instructional questions.
